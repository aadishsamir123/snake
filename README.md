# Snake Game

Use arrow keys to move the snake.
Make sure not to die by hitting yourself!


This is a simple JavaScript game that I have made so you all can play and I hope you like it!
I have open-sourced this game so that you all can clone it and make it your own and share it with me and anyone else!

Check releases for different releases that you can view.

If you want to play this game, go to this link: https://aadishsamir123.github.io/snake

Please do inform me of issues in the issues tab so I can make changes. My current change that I am trying to make is that the snake dies upon collision with the wall.
